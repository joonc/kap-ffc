At 10AM, noon, and 2PM a script runs to see if 2 or more people both responded \"yes\" and have windows that overlap. If there is a match, the two people are put in a groupme. If not, we won't message you (to minimize spam). The more people using F@N, the more often there should be matches -- feel free to invite any friends you'd like to have in the group. Hope we can match you next time! Love, The FreeAtNoon Bot."
