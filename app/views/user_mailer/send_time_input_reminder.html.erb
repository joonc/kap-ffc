    <h1>Glad you signed up <%= @user.first_name %>!</h1>
    <p>It looks like you signed up earlier today on your phone. The last thing we need is to know when youâ€™re free.</p>
    <p>Go to <a href=http://www.freeatnoon.com/users/sign_in>freeatnoon.com</a> (on a computer, not your phone). Sign in and input your rough availability. After that you'll be all set. Excited to have you in the group.</p>
    <p><a href=http://www.freeatnoon.com/users/sign_in>Finish setup now!</a></p>
    <p>Love,</br> The FreeAtNoon Bot</p>
